# Blahut-Arimoto-Algorithm-for-Gaussian-Channel
Blahut-Arimoto algorithm is a numerical method that was designed to obtain the optimal input disctribution that maximises mutual Information through a noisy channel and to obtain the Channel Capacity, which is the maximised value of Mutual Information. This Algorithm is at the core of Information Theory, now being used in biological systems as well
