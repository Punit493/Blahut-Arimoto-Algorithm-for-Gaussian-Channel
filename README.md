# Blahut-Arimoto-Algorithm-for-Gaussian-Channel
Blahut-Arimoto algorithm is a numerical method that was designed to obtain the optimal input disctribution that maximises the mutual information through a noisy channel and to obtain the Channel Capacity, which is the maximised value of Mutual Information. This Algorithm is at the core of Information Theory and has been widely used in Conputer science and engineering in the context of communication channel, now being used in biological systems as well.
